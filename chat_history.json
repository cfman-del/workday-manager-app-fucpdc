Users can:\n\n1. **Remove Staff**: Click the trash icon on any staff card \u2192 confirm deletion \u2192 staff member is removed\n2. **Remove Departments**: Click the trash icon on any department card \u2192 confirm deletion \u2192 department is removed\n\nThe implementation includes proper safety measures like confirmation dialogs and handles both success and error cases appropriately.
